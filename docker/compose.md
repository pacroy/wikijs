# Docker Compose Basics
## Why
- configure relationships between containers
- save our docker container run settings in easy-to-read file
- create one-liner developer environment startups
## Components
Comprised of 2 separate but related things
1. YAML-formatted file that describes our solution options for:
  - containers
  - networks
  - volumes
2. A CLI tool docker-compose used for local dev/test automation with those YAML files
