# Containers Everywhere = New Problems
- How do we automate container lifecycle?
- How can we easily scale out/in/up/down?
- How can we ensure our containers are re-created if they fail?
- How can we replace containers without downtime (blue/green
deploy)?
- How can we control/track where containers get started?
- How can we create cross-node virtual networks?
- How can we ensure only trusted servers run our containers?
- How can we store secrets, keys, passwords and get them to the right
container (and only that container)?
